# HQMS

Housing Queue Management System

(This was generated by Copilot because IDRC about this)

## Overview

HQMS is a system designed to manage/create hypixel housing game queues efficiently.
It reads configuration from a JSON file and generates various queue-related files based on the provided configuration.
These files are in the .htsl format or [Housing Text Scripting Language](https://github.com/BusterBrown1218/HTSL).

## Features

- Manage multiple queues and platforms.
- Generate various queue-related files.
- Configurable output directory.

## Installation

To install the dependencies, run:

```sh
cargo build
```

## Usage

To run the HQMS, use the following command:

```sh
cargo run -- <config_path>
```

If no `<config_path>` is provided, it defaults to `config.json`.

## Configuration

The configuration file should be a JSON file with the following structure:

```json
{
    "queues": [
        {
            "id": 1,
            "platforms": [
                {
                    "id": 1,
                    "spawn1": "-27 103 28",
                    "spawn2": "-18 103 28"
                }
            ]
        }
    ],
    "out_dir": "output_directory"
}
```
